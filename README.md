## Business Model Working Group
The Business Model group is working to create an economy in the Blockstack ecosystem. This group is especially focused on developing around the utility of STX tokens; they are exploring innovative use cases for Clarity smart contracts, applications for app tokens, and building app chains. The Business Model group is particularly collaborative, experimental, and generally set up to operate like a "lab". Most meetings will be workshop or hackathon-style and many will feature external speakers. This group is led by Head of Growth at Blockstack PBC, Patrick Stanley.
